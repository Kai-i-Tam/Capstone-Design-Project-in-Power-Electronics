  ## Pros
  Get the vertical design experience of Solar Power Converter.
  One of the greatest adventage of this lab is scalable, we can later using this as template to build a larger Solar Power Chargers.
  
  ## Cons
  Never got a chance to actually design the PCB based on what I have done on the prototype.
    
  ## Note to Future Development
  If I will do the PCB of this projects, some of the measurement would be better because it would be less ESR and ESL. Switching Noise will be less and efficiency would definitly gone up.
  It would be nice to sell it as a kit for future students.
