  ## Pros
  This is a very good example template for fully vertical design of Power Electronic Circuit, work around given Specs and Restrictions.
  Designing Topology, Component Reseach, Magnetic Designs, Modeling and Simulation. 
  
  ## Cons
  Everything is theorectical, the result is heavily depended on how well the math model is.
    
  ## Note to Future Development
  It would be nice to design the PCBA one day and measure the real life performance and compare how close the simulation as.
